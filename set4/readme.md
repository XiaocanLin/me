TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

ohhh,finally, finish the set 4
tutor say set4 will easy than set3, but for me set4 are super hard

i feel, in set4, is more about read and remember how to using code,
set3 are more about logic and math, i can finish set3 lessthan a hour,
but in set4, i have to take more than 3hours. ohmygod, i'am so fool.
