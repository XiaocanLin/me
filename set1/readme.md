set up my working(study) environment

04 / 06 / 2021 friday

my first lesson of CODE1161，
to be honest, I didn't prepare before class. What I thought was “oh, is the first class, definitely about introducing the syllabus and direction. It does not need to be operated anything."

viewing the lecture 1, I found that this course is different from what I imagined. course name of code1161 is 'Communication & Visualisation', I thought course will about something like communication skills,  or about art, architectural history (maybe because my english too poor, misunderstanding?), unexpectedly, it was about Code, No wonder the course is called “ CODE 1161 ”. 
The ancient Chinese military book worte：
Know yourself and your enemy,  your never end in battle  (my translate may not accurately)
It doesn’t seem appropriate to use it at this timing... my intention is admonish myself, should PREPARE BEFORE CLASS ahhh !  Of course, REVIEW AFTER CLASS also important. 
(use all capital letter to highlight)

I think the logbook I write now is kind a good way for review, and it can be used by review before exams. In fact, I don’t really understanding what does logbook have to write. It is about the difficulties and solutions that the person encountered when writing programs, or what happened when running this program, is the logbook of human, or logbook of program,or logbook when programing. I’m a little bit confused. Let’s write like this way(like diary) at today. find an opportunity asking tutor later, to not disturb the person private time.

about disturbing the tutor, I am very sorry today.
at todays class,  I opened the installation tutorial that the tutor gave us. Start to set up various software.

The installation tutorial is very detailed, the above is the installation tutorial for the Windows system, and the following is the tutorial for the Mac system.

i am a bit anxious. I didn’t read it roughly all tutorial first. I followed the Windows tutorial for a long time. (I am using a Mac system, and I’m an online student). 
i'm a bit shy, or autistic? I feel embarrassed to ask the tutor where I didn’t understand. I used Google and StarkOverflow to search for a long time, but no avail.
After setting it up for about 2~3 hours, I Just discovered there is a tutorial for Mac system. I followed the mac tutorial for a long time, and meet some problems interrupted the steps. The classtime was about to end, so I had to shamelessly send a message "i need help" to the tutor when the time near the class time end.

The tutor is very kind, enthusiastic and generous, take his private time out to start a online meeting class, guide me and some of classmates.

I saw that the tutor quickly coded with his fingers ,do lot of  'magicwork' in my program, and  each problem was solved like winter snow meet the spring sun, all fix. magical! Thanks you, my super hero - tutor!

by the tutor's description, it seems that the problem is because the Mac system comes with an old version of python2, and python3 is commonly used now, which caused some problems.

(I think: if I use the Windows system, I won’t need to bother the tutor. is time to sell the Macbook and buy a Windows System laptop.)

i hope in the future, I will also to become a person who is  proficient in multiple operating systems like the tutor.
